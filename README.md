## DISCLAIMER
I mainly made this as a proof of concept, and it is for educational purposes only. Therefore, I am **NOT** responsible if you use it and get banned.

## **Supported Versions**
Currently, Steam accounts and OTP enabled accounts are **NOT SUPPORTED**. Only launcher accounts with no OTP are supported. Steam is WIP.

## About the project
Program I made for the game *Black Desert Online*, that will automatically and instantly buy any outfits listed on the central marketplace. I am still learning, so there probably will be plenty of bugs :)


### How it works
When enabled, the program will continuously check the outfit category for stock, with a preset delay. If a stock or stocks are detected, the program will automatically buy them for you.


For the buying to work, the program will need your login credentials to log in to the [official](https://na-trade.naeu.playblackdesert.com/Intro/) BDO web marketplace. Your credentials are then saved locally, and the program will auto-relogin for you if the login expires. This means that the program will work indefinitely (though not recommended) as long as you keep it running.
