## DISCLAIMER
I mainly made this as a proof of concept, and is for educational purposes only. Therefore I am **NOT** responsible if you use it and gets banned.

## **Supported Versions**
Currently, steam accounts and OTP enabled accounts are **NOT SUPPORTED**. Only launcher accounts with no OTP is supported. Support could be easily added but I mostly likely won't do it because is against TOS.

## About the project
Just a little test program I made for the game *Black Desert Online*, that will automatically and instantly buy any outfits listed on the central marketplace. I am still learning so there probably will be plenty of bugs :)


### How it works
When enabled, the program will continuously check the outfit category for stock, with a pre set delay. If a stock or stocks are detected, the program will automatically buy them for you.


For the buying to work, the program will need your login credentials to login to the [official](https://na-trade.naeu.playblackdesert.com/Intro/) BDO web-marketplace. Your credentials are then saved locally, and the program will auto-relogin for you if the login expires. This means that the program will work indefinitely as long as you keep it running.
